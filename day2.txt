1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
          Selenium is used to automate web based application across different browsers. It is a open source automated testing framework. With a use of 14 programming Languages like Java,
Python, C#, etc to create Selenium Test Scripts.
          Components of Selenium- Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Selenium Grid, WebDriver, Selenium Grid.
          WebDriver - It is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests.       


2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
           Through Application Programming Interface (API). And, Selenium scripts creates an HTTP request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver. An HTTP request is
     then send to the server using Browser Driver. 
      

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
           ID, Name, Class name, Link text, Partial Link text, Tag name, CSS selector, Xpath.

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
       ID is the faster technique to locate desired WebElements on the page. IDs are unique for each element on the page, it is considered the fastest and safest method to locate elements
       Finding Elements using XPath  is better for locating elements having complex selectors. In Absolute XPath, If any child tagname or text field gets added, this XPath will get 
       Failure. Time Management is high and It takes long time to run.                                                                                    


5.How to select value in dropdown?
           The 'Select' class in part of WebDriver supports library. The class provides a numberof features for working with select boxes, and one useful one is selectByValue.
                  By using of selectByValue(".."), we can select values.


6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
           Absolute Xpath- Starting from root node. It starts with /. It is complex to use. Disadvantages- 1. If any tagname or text field gets added, this XPath will get Failure. 
                                                                                                           2. Time Management is high and It takes long time to run.
           Relative Xpath - Starting from current node. It starts with //. Many types of Relative Xpath- 1. Attribute based XPath 2. Text based 3. Collection Based 4. Contains Xpath. 
                                                   5. Parent to Child 6. Child to Parent 7. GrandParent to GrandChild 8. GrandChild to GrandParent 
                                                   9. ElderSibling to YoungerSibling 10. YoungerSibling to ElderSibling 11. ElderCousin to YoungerCousin 12. YoungerCousin to ElderCousin


7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
           WebElement checkBoxSelected1 = driver.findElement(By.locator(""));
			boolean isSelected1 = checkBoxSelected1.isSelected();

			if(isSelected1 == true) {
				System.out.println("Checkbox is selected");
	} else {
		        System.out.println("Checkbox is not selected");
	}

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
                 WebDriverManager- It verifies the version of the browser installed in our local machine by its own. It also uses the latest version of the driver. It makes it easy 
                                   and convert the manual stuff into automation.
                System.setProperty- Before Starting to automate the web application, we need to download the driver executable manually for the required browser. After downloading, we need
                                    to set the path. All the time, we should to keep upadted version, else it will not work.                


9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
                  ElderCousin to YoungerCousin- Eldercousin XPath/Following::tagname of the younger cousin
                  YoungerCousin to ElderCousin -Youngercousin XPath/Preceeding::tagname of the Elder cousin


10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
                   By using of getAttribute(). It is a method helps to get the value of any attribute of a web element, which is returned as a string.
